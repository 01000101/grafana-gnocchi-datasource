Not yet implemented
===================


Current Limitation
==================

Grafana doesnâ€™t allow to query two different servers when using the proxy mode,
so we are not able to query Keystone for a token and then query gnocchi.

In proxymode, we need to set a token and the Gnocchi URL on the datasource.

In direct mode, we can use login/password and the Keystone URL.
Note that CORS MUST be enabled on Keystone and Gnocchi servers.
